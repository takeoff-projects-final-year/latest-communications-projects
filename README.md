Still need more [Communications Projects](https://takeoffprojects.com/communications-projects) then below ideas will help you: -

Wireless Communication System: Design a system that allows wireless communication between two or more devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This project can be useful in the field of IoT and can help you understand the concepts of wireless communication.

Voice-activated Robot: Build a robot that can be controlled using voice commands. This project can be useful in the field of robotics and can help you develop skills in programming and control systems.

Traffic Light Control System: Design a system that controls traffic lights based on traffic density and ensures smooth traffic flow. This project can be useful in the field of transportation and can help you understand the concepts of control systems.

Design a wireless sensor network: Develop a wireless sensor network for monitoring environmental conditions in a building or an outdoor space. The network could include sensors for temperature, humidity, light, sound, and air quality, and could use wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

Build a communication system for a drone: Develop a communication system that enables a drone to transmit data and receive commands in real-time. The system could use radio frequency (RF) or satellite communication technologies, and should be lightweight and efficient to minimize power consumption.

Create a voice-controlled home automation system: Develop a home automation system that can be controlled using voice commands. The system could include smart lights, thermostats, security cameras, and other devices, and should use a voice recognition technology such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

Design a satellite communication system: Develop a communication system for a satellite that enables it to transmit data and receive commands from a ground station. The system could use RF or optical communication technologies, and should be designed to operate in space with limited power and bandwidth.

Create a mobile app for communication: Develop a mobile app that allows users to communicate with each other using text, voice, and video. The app could use a cloud-based server to manage communication and could be designed for iOS or Android devices.

Develop a radio-frequency identification (RFID) system: Design an RFID system that can track and monitor the movement of objects or people. The system could include RFID tags, readers, and a software platform for data collection and analysis.

Create a virtual reality (VR) communication system: Develop a VR communication system that allows users to interact with each other in a virtual environment. The system could use VR headsets and controllers, and could be designed for gaming, education, or other applications.
